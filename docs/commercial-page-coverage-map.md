# Commercial Page Coverage Map

Updated: 2026-04-11

## Purpose

This document tracks the first completed phase of CertiSpares' commercial-page system.

The goal is to keep three layers aligned:

- core service pages
- commercial landing pages under `/product/`
- blog articles that now route informational traffic toward those commercial pages

This file is meant to support the next stages of work:

- reverse-link planning
- duplicate-id cleanup
- future brand and part-category expansion

---

## Core Structure

### Core service pages

- `/`
  Value proposition page
- `/sourcing/`
  Main sourcing-service page
- `/capabilities/`
  Capability proof page
- `/how-it-works/`
  Workflow page
- `/contact/`
  RFQ conversion page

### Product entry logic

- `/product/`
  Pivot-style entry page for inquiry-based sourcing
- `/product/brand/[brand]/`
  Brand-led commercial pages
- `/product/part/[part-category]/`
  Part-system commercial pages

Important constraint:

- CertiSpares does not present a public SKU or OE database.
- Matching remains inquiry-based through OE number, VIN, part list, photos, dimensions, quantities, and vehicle details.

## Brand Landing Pages

### Domestic and China-linked truck brands

- `/product/brand/howo/`
- `/product/brand/shacman/`
- `/product/brand/dongfeng/`
- `/product/brand/foton/`
- `/product/brand/faw/`
- `/product/brand/jac/`

### International truck brands supported through China-based sourcing

- `/product/brand/man/`
- `/product/brand/volvo-truck/`
- `/product/brand/mercedes-benz-truck/`

### Current gap

- `Sinotruk` does not yet exist as a separate brand landing page.

---

## Part-System Landing Pages

- `/product/part/engine-parts/`
- `/product/part/brake-system-parts/`
- `/product/part/air-system-parts/`
- `/product/part/suspension-parts/`
- `/product/part/steering-parts/`
- `/product/part/axle-and-wheel-end-parts/`
- `/product/part/clutch-and-transmission-parts/`
- `/product/part/electrical-parts/`
- `/product/part/cooling-system-parts/`
- `/product/part/rubber-and-bushing-parts/`

## Commercial Pages Already Supported by Existing Blog Traffic

### Strongest support so far

- `/product/part/brake-system-parts/`
- `/product/part/suspension-parts/`
- `/product/part/air-system-parts/`
- `/product/part/engine-parts/`
- `/product/part/axle-and-wheel-end-parts/`
- `/product/part/rubber-and-bushing-parts/`
- `/product/brand/howo/`
- `/product/brand/man/`

### Medium support so far

- `/product/brand/shacman/`
- `/product/part/clutch-and-transmission-parts/`
- `/product/`

### Still weaker and likely to need future routing

- `/product/brand/dongfeng/`
- `/product/brand/foton/`
- `/product/brand/faw/`
- `/product/brand/jac/`
- `/product/brand/volvo-truck/`
- `/product/brand/mercedes-benz-truck/`
- `/product/part/electrical-parts/`
- `/product/part/cooling-system-parts/`
- `/product/part/steering-parts/`

---

## Build Status

Current known state after this phase:

- `npm run build` passes
- site currently builds to 74 pages
- sitemap generation succeeds

Known deferred issue:

- Astro `Duplicate id` warnings still appear intermittently on recently edited blog files
- cleanup has been intentionally deferred to a later concentrated pass

---

## Recommended Next Phase

### Option 1: Finish coverage gaps

Add blog-routing support for weaker commercial pages, especially:

- steering-related blogs -> `/product/part/steering-parts/`
- electrical or service-item blogs -> `/product/part/electrical-parts/`
- cooling or wear-related blogs -> `/product/part/cooling-system-parts/`
- regional or buyer-intent pages -> selected international brand pages

### Option 2: Concentrated cleanup pass

- clear Astro cache
- remove duplicate-id warnings
- verify no accidental duplicate content registration remains

### Option 3: Commercial-page interlink refinement

- improve cross-links among brand pages
- improve cross-links among part-system pages
- define stronger brand-to-part and part-to-brand navigation paths
